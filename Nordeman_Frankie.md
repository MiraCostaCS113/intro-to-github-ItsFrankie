My name is Frankie Nordeman, I am 24 years old and this is my seventh year at miracosta.
I'm a Computer Science major and I plan to graduate after 2025 or in the middle of 2026.
It has been five years since I've taken Java, but I've been reviewing it, and C++ has a lot in common with it.
During my free time, I like to play video games, watch youtube, and spend time with friends.
I also like puppies, I have two little ones. They like pet pats and get excited whenever I get home from school.
